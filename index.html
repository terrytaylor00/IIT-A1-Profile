					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>As IT encapsulates a large range of ideas and aspects, finding interest in one section of IT or another has never eluded me. Specifically diagnosing technical problems with computer hardware and software has always been something I have been doing since a young age. Growing up I have only sought to further my knowledge of technology and the implications technology has on our world in the current time.</p>
					<p>In terms of a particular event or person that has sparked this interest, I believe some of this can be offloaded to people like my father and uncle, who both built their own computers especially in a time where that wasn’t as consumer friendly as it is now. Being around households where computers and technology was consistently being talked about or interacted with definitely helped. I have had some professional experience with IT, I completed my year 10 work experience program at an IT solution company in my hometown, upon this I was also responsible for the file migration of a finance company to a new document management system.</p>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT for my further education as I had heard and read a lot about the school’s more hands-on approach to technological teaching which I believe resonated with me. I expect to learn about how small team environments work and the subsequent development cycles of potential projects, mimicking how it would be in a business. Furthermore I believe specific knowledge into database tools, programming languages, and networking will also be further developed.</p>

					<h2>Sys Admin / IT Manager</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The listing details a System Admin/IT Manager role where there are multiple responsibilities. These responsibilities can be grouped into network-based and general IT technical support. Starting off with the general IT technical support, the role describes the maintenance of the business’ current software workflow with the emphasis being placed on three programs WHMCS, Xero and WorkFlowMax. The description also includes a responsibility to troubleshoot the business’s general computer hardware and software issues. On the network side the role describes having to upkeep a VMware server that hosts custom websites and to ensure the security of the backup systems within the network. The position itself is 20 hours part time but has a significantly large 110-129k salary range, as well as the ability to work remotely. As such I believe the part time hours are desirable alongside the work from home ability as this promotes a good balance as I am currently under the mindset that you work to live, not live to work.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Currently my skills in relation to this listing would be having limited knowledge of databases and computer systems. I have also worked with WordPress websites before and am aware of AWS as a concept. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The tangible skills within the listing are - a relevant tertiary qualification, having working knowledge of computer systems, systems administration, network security, and databases, experience with WHMCS, cPanel, DNS and AWS, as well as WordPress. The other skills listed are mainly business related buzzwords or are intangible to demonstrate. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Now to gain the remaining knowledge applicable to this position would require different steps. First more experience with actual administration tools would be necessary and would most likely be obtained within a business environment. Next my networking knowledge and skills would need to be improved upon, this could involve me choosing networking classes, like the CISCO networking minor that this IT course provides. Moving on specific time would have to be dedicated to looking into the specific tools and software they list like WHMCS, cPanel to ensure I have working knowledge.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Logician Personality INTP-A</p>
					<h3>Implication of this Personality Type</h3>
					<p>There are some notable factors this personality type will have within a team setting. The description lists being easily dissatisfied and seeking perfection as a trait, within a team project this has issues on when to stop a project’s development for example. I believe this is mitigated early on by quickly determining the scope of any given task and sticking with it, being careful for projects to remain feasible. I do know I have done this specific test before and received a different, reproducible, result at the time but accounting this between my own personality changing over time or the test’s validity is difficult to say. Some of the questions I believe are too open to interpretation and it was not clearly indicated if this was by design or not, as such for some questions my answers easily could've been on either end of the spectrum.</p>

					<h2>Test Two - Learning Preference Test Result </h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences (retrieved from https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire)</p>
					<p>Result determined was that my learning preference was 'Mild Kinesthetic', which can be described as utilising practical exercises, experiences, examples, trial and error, using things that are real. The implications this has for me within an IT course may be extreme, however I believe that trial and error into learning a new software has always been my experience.</p>
					<p>In terms of how this would affect a team environment, this may indicate that I would want to rush the development to a working prototype to actually experience the product or system first hand and then delve into bug-fixing, more detailed work etc. As such forming teams who may also be aligned to this work flow may be beneficial.</p>
					<p>The validity of this particular test could be called into account as many of the questions involved real life examples where certain answers are obviously best despite the learning style, for example a question about the best way to learn about a new property you want to live in had the following options, ask the owner, look at the building plan, inspect the place in person, or read a description of the property. Each option in theory can be assigned to a different learning style, like aural learning style if you asked the owner, however in practice no one would realistically believe anything but looking at the property in real life would be the best. These nuances are not touched or addressed in the test description.</p>

					<h2>Test Three - Big 5 Personality Test</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors (retrieved from https://www.truity.com/test-results/bigfive/18225/34730415 )</p>
					<p>Results: Openness - 81, Conscientiousness - 25, Extraversion - 42, Agreeableness - 52,  Neuroticism - 69</p>
					<p>Touching briefly on each result - my openness score indicates more creative, adventurous and intellectual experiences compared to seeking practical, conventional and focused methods. My low conscientiousness score indicates impulsive behaviour, easily being sidetracked. My slightly lower than half  extraversion score indicates I would be more socially conservative, introverted, than extraverted. My middling agreeableness score would demonstrate a balance between emphasis on other people’s needs compared to my own. Finally my high neuroticism score would mean I would show a higher tendency to experience negative emotions especially facing adversity.</p>
					<p>Specifically looking at these results through the lens of teamwork, the agreeableness and conscientiousness results, I believe, are most relevant. Ensuring I put emphasis on other people’s needs, as described in the agreeableness trait, is paramount in ensuring smooth working relationships. Furthermore my apparent tendency to get sidetracked means I would have to put more conscious effort and consideration into my team’s time and as such would be beneficial to potentially group with people who would be able to keep a focused goal for a project.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				<img src="gamephoto.png" alt="gameidea" />
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The chosen project will be a 3d game-like program in which users will be able to control a motor vehicle and drive it on different types of roads and scenarios. The main point of the program will be to properly teach Victorian driving rules and provide indication on whether or not a user has broken the law or otherwise how they have followed the road laws.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The project will be useful as a learning tool for both new and ‘experienced’ drivers. Driving accidents and fatalities are one of the most dangerous aspects of modern Australian society, where despite lockdowns facing Victorians in 2021 “there were 237 road fatalities on Victorian roads in 2021 - 26 more than in 2020.”. With no foreseeable significant change on Victorian or Australian car-dependency in terms of infrastructure, culture or laws, it would be beneficial that for people who have to drive, that they atleast have access to appropriate tools to know how to be safe on the road.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The idea for the potential program would likely be scaled to include differing aspects upon further development, however the full vision for the project can be detailed.</p>
					<p>The 3d program would likely have scenarios in which users can choose from a starting UI menu. These scenarios will act like game levels, they will depict the most common dangerous scenarios that real life driving accidents may occur, for example how to navigate a large intersection. Upon choosing a scenario the user will most likely receive information about the relevant rules through UI elements, and will subsequently be given control of a 3d modelled car on a road emulating what a real driving environment may look like. How specifically these environments will look artistically will be touched upon further in this description. The player will then be prompted to navigate through the driving scenario controlling the car with the keyboard, if they cause any actions that would break laws or otherwise be dangerous the game will notify the user of their misaction through UI elements and give information on what to do next time.</p>
					<p>Another aspect of the program would be a mode separate from choosing a scenario. Instead the game would feature an open driving mode where the user could spawn into an open driving environment with no objective. Instead the user would drive around and follow road rules, allowing them to experiment with what they can and can’t do, the system would still penalise or notify them of any mishaps.</p>
					<p>In terms of the look of the game it is most likely that the program will be developed in a simplistic art style so features like roads, pedestrians and signs are easily identifiable and also allows development be emphasised on showing the most scenarios compared to art style. Using low polygon models and simplistic textures also means the program should be playable on many different devices, potentially even within a browser, allowing the highest level of accessibility to anyone.</p>
					<p>Limitation of the project would include the exclusion of online connectivity or multiplayer gameplay. As the goal of the project is to promote positive driving behaviour, playing with other people  would most likely have the opposite effect and encourage players to recklessly drive for fun. Another limitation would be the exclusion of different vehicles, unless specific to a discovered law or rule (like rules governing towing), the project would not feature different vehicles as this distracts from the driving safe aspect if people were able to use a faster car for example.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The foundation of this game program would be a suitable game engine to develop the program in. Specifically it is expected that this program would be developed in Unity. Unity allows for multiplatform development which would be useful if wanting to reach the largest number of people on different platforms. Furthermore Unity being one of the most publicly utilised game engines means there are plenty of resources to be able to learn and develop the project online. It is expected that the team would use the 3d game aspect of unity and develop the game utilising either C# scripting language or the powerful visual scripting tools Unity has built in. As the program is expected to be in 3D, the creation of 3d assets will be needed. As such it is expected that Blender will be used. Blender is an open source 3d modelling tool that is also extremely popular. Blender will be used to create 3d models to be imported and used in Unity.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required would include intermediary experience with Unity, having a solid foundational knowledge navigating the software and implementing basic gameplay elements. As such elements will need to be programmed a knowledge of C# or the visual scripting language would be necessary. As Unity is the most popular creator game engine, finding videos or resources to learn the software as well as its visual scripting aspect should be relatively easy. The knowledge of 3d modelling within blender would also be needed, specifically making models suitable and efficient for in-game rendering, similarly however as Blender is extremely popular finding online resources should not be difficult.</p>
					<p>Knowledge that is specific to this project’s idea would be knowledge of Victorian driving laws. As these laws by nature should be of public interest and knowledge it should pose no issue in finding the relevant laws or rules in regard to driving. Websites such as vicRoads will most likely be the starting point in finding this knowledge.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful an overall increase in driver awareness and knowledge would be the most sought after outcome. Packaging essential knowledge in a captivating 3d experience would ensure that the program is further propagated within the general driving community. As such driving safety can only be achieved when everyone, at minimum, has a basic knowledge of the rules and importance of such rules.</p>
